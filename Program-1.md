## Program 1 - Getting Our Feet Wet

### Basic Idea
In class we've mainly discussed basic generalities describing and dealing with the whole "Big Data" concept.
So, for this programming project, we will get a small taste of dealing with big data. More specifically we
will deal with converting a large set of data from one format to another. 

In an academic setting, it's very typical that programming assignments may solve difficult problems, but solve
them very quickly! Meaning the implementation of a complex data structure may be conceptually difficult, but
when it comes to running or testing your program, it usually uses a very small data set, and if it runs any longer
than a few seconds, you think it's broken and possibly in an endless loop. Well that is about to stop. 

### Requirements

You are given a set of GPS data points. Actually, your given the same set of GPS data points in three different
formats:

```bash
-rw-rw-r--  1 griffin griffin 484M Sep  2 17:20 GpsFilePoints.csv
-rw-rw-r--  1 griffin griffin 467M Sep  2 17:22 GpsFilePoints.sql
-rw-rw-r--  1 griffin griffin 2.3G Sep  2 17:24 GpsFilePoints.xml
```
