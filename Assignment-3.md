### Assignment 3 - Installing Hadoop.
#### Due: Mon Sep 15<sup>th</sup> by class time.

#### Install Hadoop
-----

Follow the steps in the tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-hadoop-on-ubuntu-13-10), to install hadoop on your server.

-----

#### Questions

- How do you add nodes to your Hadoop cluster?
- Can everyone in class add the remaining members of the class to thier cluster? This asks the question: "Can everyone simultaneously run thier own Hadoop cluster, AND be a slave (worker) in another Hadoop cluster?" This would obviously never be ideal in the real world, but can this work as a model in our BigData course? Otherwise, you will be running your assignments on a single server, which doesn't fit with the whole `Big Data` theme.


Write your answer up in a file named: `Assignment3-Writeup.md` and put it in your repository.
