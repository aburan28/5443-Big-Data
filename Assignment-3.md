#### Questions

- How do you add nodes to your Hadoop cluster?
- Can everyone in class add the remaining members of the class to thier cluster? This asks the question: "Can everyone simultaneously run thier own Hadoop cluster, AND be a slave (worker) in another Hadoop cluster?" This would obviously never be ideal in the real world, but can this work as a model in our BigData course?
