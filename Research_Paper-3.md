### Paper 3<sup>rd</sup> Assignment


___Overview___
- You now have a topic picked, and 5 papers summarized.
- Before you write your paper, you need to organize your thoughts and the direction you want to go.
- Were not going to start by preparing an outline, but we will start by determining which specific sub-categories you want to discuss. 
- Don't think about: Introduction, Overview, or Motivation, instead think about breaking your topic down into easily digestible chunks. Each of these `chunks` is a sub-topic.
    - For example if I were discussing programming languages, I could have a paragraphs describing each of the following: `C`, `C++`, `Python`, `Javascript`, `Lisp`. 
    - Or, I could approach it from a categorical standpoint: `Object Oriented Languages`, `Functional Languages`, `Scripting Languages`.
- If your writing in support of a particular subject, your should provide multiple viewpoints, some supporting and some negating your point of view.

___This Thursday___
- Come up with a title for your paper. It should be descriptive, but doesn't have to cover every detail.
    - A title summarizes the main idea of the paper.
    - A title has a length of 12 words or fewer (not set in stone). 
    - A title includes only words that contribute meaning.
- Bring a bulleted list of paragraph "sub-topics" organizing the "body" of your paper. 
    - Think of "teaching" your topic to someone.
